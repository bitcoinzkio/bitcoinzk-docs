# Governance Token

**Zyra** is the native governance token of the BitcoinZK network. It is important to clarify: **Zyra is not a utility token used to pay for transaction fees (Gas Fees)**. All Gas on the BitcoinZK network is paid in **Bitcoin (BTC)**. Zyra’s core function is decentralized governance, granting holders the right to participate in managing, upgrading, and optimizing the BitcoinZK ecosystem.

Zyra’s tokenomics and functional design are fully centered around the principle of **governance**, with the goal of entrusting the future of the BitcoinZK network to its community.

## **Governance Rights**

Zyra holders possess the following key governance powers:

**Protocol Upgrades and Parameter Adjustments**:

Vote on BitcoinZK Improvement Proposals (BZIPs), which may include technical upgrades, adjustments to the gas fee mechanism, and enhancements to the security model.

**Treasury Management**:

BitcoinZK will generate a portion of protocol-level revenue denominated in BTC (e.g., Sequencer auctions, gas fee sharing). These funds are deposited into a community treasury. Zyra holders can vote on how these funds are used, such as:

* Allocating ecosystem grants to support new projects, hackathons, and developer grants.

* Funding public goods, including infrastructure, research, and education initiatives.

* Supporting other ecosystem initiatives that benefit the network’s long-term growth.

**Core Infrastructure Governance**:

Vote on or approve critical service providers within the network, such as mechanisms for selecting Sequencers or members of the Data Availability Committee (DAC).

**Ecosystem Integration Decisions**:

Community votes on major ecosystem collaborations, strategic partnerships, and which assets are supported via official bridging mechanisms.

## **Token Distribution and Release Mechanism**

To ensure long-term decentralization and sustainable growth, Zyra will follow a **fair launch** principle in its token distribution. A potential allocation breakdown is as follows:

**Total supply: 1 billion**

| Token Allocation           | Percentage | Rules                                                        |

## **Governance Process**

BitcoinZK will adopt an on-chain governance model. The process may include the following steps:

* **Proposal Submission:**

Addresses holding more than a specified amount of Zyra tokens may submit governance proposals.

* **Discussion Period:**

Proposals will undergo thorough community discussion on official forums and social media platforms.

* **Voting Period:**

Zyra holders may stake their tokens or use them directly to vote. Voting power is proportional to the amount of tokens staked.

* **Proposal Execution:**

Proposals that meet quorum and pass the approval threshold will be executed automatically by a multisig wallet or designated smart contracts.

Zyra serves as the “digital constitution” of the BitcoinZK network and is the core of its decentralized governance. It is not used for paying gas fees; instead, it is dedicated to empowering the community—enabling users, developers, and holders to collectively shape the future of Bitcoin Layer-2. By holding and staking Zyra, participants not only demonstrate trust in BitcoinZK’s technology, but also gain the direct right and responsibility to govern this critical infrastructure.
