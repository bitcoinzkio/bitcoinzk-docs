In our philosophy, "Scaling Bitcoin" exactly means helping Bitcoin achieve what users expect it to do (yet cannot accomplish by itself because of certain limitations).

From this definition, we can easily enumerate the two main user expectations that Bitcoin has not met:

* **Higher throughput** (which implies higher TPS and lower transaction fees)

* **Stronger contract capabilities** (preferably Turing-complete ones for building application ecosystems)

BitcoinZK is here to solve these two problems. We bring much higher throughput and much stronger smart contract capability to Bitcoin. This is the very mission of bitcoinZK.

However, we recognize that by largely enhancing Bitcoin's throughput and contract capability, we are inevitably bringing additional trust assumptions (which is a bad thing) to Layer-2.

The inevitability comes from two inherent limitations of Bitcoin:

* Bitcoin's current scripting schemes cannot natively verify transactions submitted by a rollup Layer-2

* Bitcoin's scripting and UTXO design have posed very strong limitations on its capability boundary, making it difficult to support more complex and diversified user scenarios such as DeFi.
