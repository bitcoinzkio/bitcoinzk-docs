What is Bitcoin Layer-2ï¼Ÿ In the context of Bitcoin, we have long been discussing the concept of "Scaling". For example, Lightning Network is an early exploration of scaling Bitcoin payments, which, if taken from today's perspective, can be defined as a Bitcoin Layer-2 solution. Although the concept of Layer-2 is not yet clearly characterized, we observe that the market has begun to draw extensive parallels with Ethereum's Layer-2/Rollup solutions to Bitcoin's scaling issues. Therefore, for ease of understanding, we also position BitcoinZK as a Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin.

There are still many debates about Rollup and Layer-2 regarding how they should be defined. For us, we are more concerned about scaling Bitcoin, bringing real value to Bitcoin users, and addressing security concerns within a Layer-2 solution. Therefore, we will not attempt to answer questions such as  "what kind of scaling solution should be considered for Layer-2". Instead, we will try to explain how we can use the technologies available to us to construct a complete solution and future development path for scaling Bitcoin with a Layer-2 network.
