# About BitcoinZK

Scaling Bitcoin with ZK. Zero-knowledge, Zero-trust, zero-wait.

## What is BitcoinZK

BitcoinZK is a revolutionary layer 2 for bitcoin. BitcoinZK aims to offer the most powerful scaling solution ever to bitcoin users: high-throughput, BTC-native, Turing-complete and Modular-constructed.

BitcoinZK guarantees 100% ZK features where 100% user behaviors will be proved by ZK, and 100% ZK Proof will be kept publicly verifiable.

## Design Philosophy

The design of BitcoinZK is primarily driven by the goal of better serving and scaling Bitcoin (the Layer1). It is worth noting that there is currently no clear definition or specification telling us what a Bitcoin Layer2 should look like. Therefore, before discussing our solution, it is necessary to first define the exact problems we want to solve.

We believe that the scaling needed for Bitcoin can be summarized in three aspects: Throughput, Contract Capability, and Fewer Security Compromises.

**Throughput**:  
Throughput enhancement means higher in TPS (Transactions Per Second) and reduced transaction fees. This will create the possibility for a richer ecosystem of dapps, alternative assets and use scenarios.

**Smart Contract Capability**:  
We must face the fact that Bitcoin's scripting capabilities, even after the Taproot upgrade, have clear limitations. While we can already use Taproot scripts to implement complex transaction logic, it is far from a more general capability. This limitation confines Bitcoin's application ecosystem to a very small range.  
We believe that, considering Bitcoin's philosophy of simplicity, a Layer2 that provides stronger contract capabilities (especially concerning Turing-complete contracts) to the Bitcoin Layer1 makes great sense because such a layer can introduce breakthroughs in both efficiency and capability boundaries.

**Fewer Security Compromises**:  
Given Bitcoin's constraints and our goals of achieving throughput and contract capability breakthroughs, we notice that a Layer2 solution without any compromise in security is just not practical. However, a qualified Layer2 solution should clearly define the trust assumptions introduced, demonstrate why they are necessary, and consider pathways to minimize them in the future. We will also dedicate space in later chapters to elaborate on our views and solutions regarding this matter.
