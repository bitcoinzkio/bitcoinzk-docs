**BitcoinZK** is a Bitcoin-based Layer-2 solution that integrates th&#x65;**&#x20;BitVM framework and Zero-Knowledge** to bring Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contract functionality to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Its design goal is to extend Bitcoin’s capabilities, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) such as DeFi, NFTs, and asset issuance, while using native BTC as Gas fees and inheriting Bitcoin’s security and decentralization.BitcoinVM employs a **modular architecture**, leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK Proofs), Taproot scripts, and the **BitVM** paradigm to achieve an efficient, scalable smart contract execution environment.&#x20;
