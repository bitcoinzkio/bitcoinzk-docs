While we can already use Taproot scripts to implement complex transaction logic, it is far from a more general capability. This limitation confines Bitcoin's application ecosystem to a very small range.\nWe believe that, considering Bitcoin's philosophy of simplicity, a Layer-2 that provides stronger contract capabilities (especially concerning Turing-complete contracts) to the Bitcoin Layer-1 makes great sense because such a layer can introduce breakthroughs in both efficiency and capability boundaries."]}),"\n",(0,n.jsxs)(i.p,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"Fewer Security Compromises"}),":\nGiven Bitcoin's constraints and our goals of achieving throughput and contract capability breakthroughs, we notice that a Layer-2 solution without any compromise in security is just not practical. However, a qualified Layer-2 solution should clearly define the trust assumptions introduced, demonstrate why they are necessary, and consider pathways to minimize them in the future.
