However, this approach consumes a lot of resources. The market has widely accepted the verification scheme called Fraud Proof (the OptimismLayer-2 style) to save resources consumed by on-chain verification. Here, the advantages of ZK come into play because ZK proofs are succinct, meaning that verifiers only need to perform fewer computations (much less than generating ZK proofs) to complete the verification. This is perfect for Layer-2 solutions because Layer-2 exists to solve the performance limitations and resource shortages (mainly execution resources) of Layer-1.
