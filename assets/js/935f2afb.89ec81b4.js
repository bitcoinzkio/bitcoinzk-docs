Its design goal is to extend Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) such as DeFi, NFTs, and asset issuance, while using native BTC as Gas fees and inheriting Bitcoin\u2019s security and decentralization.BitcoinVM employs a modular architecture, leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK Proofs), Taproot scripts, and the BitVM paradigm to achieve an efficient, scalable smart contract execution environment.&#x20;","sidebar":"docs"},"About BitcoinZK/BitcoinZK Architecture":{"id":"About BitcoinZK/BitcoinZK Architecture","title":"BitcoinZK Architecture","description":"The purpose of a Bitcoin Layer-2, in a nutshell, is to scale Bitcoin (Layer-1), in terms of performance (higher throughput, lower fees) or capability (Layer-2 achieves what Layer-1 cannot do, e.g., Turing-complete smart contracts for Bitcoin). Any network that meets such a purpose can be defined as a Bitcoin Layer-2.","sidebar":"docs"},"About BitcoinZK/Technical Foundations":{"id":"About BitcoinZK/Technical Foundations","title":"Technical Foundations","description":"Zero-knowledge","sidebar":"docs"},"About BitcoinZK/ZKBridge":{"id":"About BitcoinZK/ZKBridge","title":"ZKBridge","description":"zkBridge is one of the key components in BitcoinZK as it safeguards fund transition between Bitcoin Layer-1 and BitcoinZK Layer-2.","sidebar":"docs"},"Background/Bitcoin Layer2":{"id":"Background/Bitcoin Layer2","title":"Bitcoin Layer2","description":"What is Bitcoin Layer-2\uff1f In the context of Bitcoin, we have long been discussing the concept of \\"Scaling\\". For example, Lightning Network is an early exploration of scaling Bitcoin payments, which, if taken from today\'s perspective, can be defined as a Bitcoin Layer-2 solution. Although the concept of Layer-2 is not yet clearly characterized, we observe that the market has begun to draw extensive parallels with Ethereum\'s Layer-2/Rollup solutions to Bitcoin\'s scaling issues. Therefore, for ease of understanding, we also position BitcoinZK as a Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin.","sidebar":"docs"},"Background/Our Design Philosophy":{"id":"Background/Our Design Philosophy","title":"Our Design Philosophy","description":"The design of BitcoinZK is primarily driven by the goal of better serving and scaling Bitcoin (the Layer-1). It is worth noting that there is currently no clear definition or specification telling us what a Bitcoin Layer-2 should look like. Therefore, before discussing our solution, it is necessary to first define the exact problems we want to solve.","sidebar":"docs"},"Background/The Bottlenecks":{"id":"Background/The Bottlenecks","title":"The Bottlenecks","description":"In our philosophy, \\"Scaling Bitcoin\\" exactly means helping Bitcoin achieve what users expect it to do (yet cannot accomplish by itself because of certain limitations).","sidebar":"docs"},"Build on BitcoinZK/BTC Connect":{"id":"Build on BitcoinZK/BTC Connect","title":"BTC Connect","description":"BTC Connect, powered by Particle Network, is introduced as the first account abstraction protocol designed for the Bitcoin ecosystem. It implements the ERC-4337 standard on EVM-compatible Bitcoin Layer-2 solutions, enabling native Bitcoin wallets (such as UniSat, OKX, or BitGet) to control smart accounts on these Layer-2 networks. This is achieved by assigning an EVM-based smart account to a user\u2019s Bitcoin wallet, allowing seamless interaction between Bitcoin Layer-1 transactions and Layer-2 smart contract functionalities without requiring users to switch wallets or interfaces. BTC Connect includes components like a smart account, Paymaster, Bundler, and a Bitcoin-specific modal, facilitating features such as gasless transactions, batched operations, and session keys. The protocol leverages the inherent compatibility between Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s ECDSA (secp256k1) signature generation, enabling Bitcoin wallets to sign EVM UserOperations directly, bridging the gap between Bitcoin\u2019s native ecosystem and EVM-compatible Layer-2s.","sidebar":"docs"},"Build on BitcoinZK/Github":{"id":"Build on BitcoinZK/Github","title":"Github","description":"BitcoinZK Chain","sidebar":"docs"},"Build on BitcoinZK/Network Information":{"id":"Build on BitcoinZK/Network Information","title":"Network Information","description":"Devnet","sidebar":"docs"}}}')}}]);
